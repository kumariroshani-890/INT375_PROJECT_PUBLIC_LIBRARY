# 📚 Public Library Analytics Using Python

## Overview
This project delves into patterns and insights within a public library dataset using Python. By exploring how factors like population size influence library visits and examining regional disparities in library expenditures, the aim was to uncover meaningful, data-driven narratives about libraries across the globe.

This project was undertaken as part of the INT375 – Data Science with Python course at Lovely Professional University, under the School of Computer Science and Engineering.

## 📈 Objectives & Visualizations

### 1️⃣ Population vs Total Library Visits
- **Tool:** Scatter Plot  
- **Insight:** Visits generally increase with population, but show variance in high-density regions.

### 2️⃣ Population vs Registered Borrowers
- **Tool:** Regression Plot  
- **Insight:** A moderately strong positive correlation between population and registered borrowers.

### 3️⃣ Average Operating Expenditure by County
- **Tool:** Bar Chart  
- **Insight:** Showed uneven investment across counties, revealing financial disparities.

### 4️⃣ Top Counties by Library Visits
- **Tool:** Pie Chart  
- **Insight:** Identified the most active counties in terms of library usage.

### 5️⃣ Collection Per Capita Distribution
- **Tool:** Box Plot  
- **Insight:** Some counties provide significantly richer collections per person than others.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Public Libraries dataset (`Public_Libraries.csv`)
- **Cleaning Tasks:**
  - Dropped columns with 100% missing values
  - Filled missing values using median imputation
  - Exported the cleaned data to a new CSV for analysis
